         When you only wanna do me dirty? (Uh-huh-uh)
         But I hit right back 'cause you got that, that, yeah

         Why you always wanna act like lovers?â€¦
         But you never wanna be each other's (uh-huh-uh)
         I say don't look back but I go right back, yeah

         All of a sudden, I'm hypnotized
         You're the one that I can't deny
         Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away

         You turn me on like a light switch
         When you're movin' your body around and around
         Now, I don't wanna fight this (no)
         You know how to just make me want

         You turn me on like a light switch

         I got it from my daddy
    I got it from my daddy
    I got it, got it (hey, where did you get that body from?)
    I got it from my daddy
    I got it from my daddy
    I got it, got it (hey, where did you get that body from?)
